git pull

# now youre up tpdate, and can create a safe branch to make changes in
# if the branch doesnt exist yet: 
git checkout -b feature/yourname
# else 
git switch feature/yourname
#
# make changes in this branch then : 
git status

#confirm your on your branch and not on main
git add .
git commit -m"you message"
git push

# it might recomend you set upstream if its the first push, just copy that line and use it for pushing
-> 
$ git push
fatal: The current branch testbranch has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin testbranch       <<<<-------- run this line!!!

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
